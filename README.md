# React Weather-app

React weather app made with funcional component and open Weather Api

## Features
- make more css styling for components (animation on search overlay component)

- theme accesability 
- loading on components (with animation)
- local storage to save favorites cities

- hide api key <- propel way to do it use some kind of backend response to fully hide it, api is free to use so its no matter if its showed or hide. Probably will be done in future when i learn some backend
- metric could be change by changing in link metric ( currently is converted using function)

## Bugs:
- button location(on load perfect, bug came when user decline location on load and after allow location, then user need allow two times to get current location weather)
- some kind of bug on mobile on first load that doeasnt ask user for current location, and button doeasnt work too!!
-on ios app doeasnt ask for location on load

## Done:
- ~~favourite cities~~

- ~~css fixes for mobile~~

- ~~issue with first load componed that contain 5 days forcast doeasnt show~~

- ~~change photo of weather depend on current weather~~

- ~~button temperature functionality~~

## Lessons Learned
